With critical secrets buried in his past, Evan must work with the Infinites to unlock the answers in his memories in a race against time to save humanity from one of their own (Chiwetel Ejiofor) who seeks to end all life to stop what he views as the cursed, endless cycle of reincarnation.\\n\\n* * *\\n[man] There are among us a people, gifted with a perfect memory of all their past lives.\\nThey call themselves Infinites.\\nAmong the Infinites, two groups have vied for power.\\nOn one side the Believers, dedicated to using their knowledge for the protection and growth of all humanity.\\nAgainst them stand the Nihilists, who see this power as a curse.\\nNew technologies have given the Nihilists an opportunity to end all life on earth.\\nAnd the race is on for its control.\\n[sirens wailing]\\n[groans]\\n[yells]\\n[tires squealing]\\n[man] Treadway, tell me you got it.\\nYeah.

Not so great.\\nBut I’m good.

This is no version of reincarnation I’ve ever heard of.\\nBuddhist, Hindu, Sikh.\\nThey believe each life begins with a clean slate.\\nThe answers you’ve been looking for all your life… all you gotta do is get on that plane.\\nYou know what I’m really asking myself right now is?\\nWhat if the craziest thing I’ve ever heard… and this is some crazy shit… is actually the first thing that’s ever made any goddamn sense?\\nI don’t gotta go feed the cat, so… let’s go.\\n[speaking Italian]\\nGo on.\\n[speaking, gurgling, choking]\\n[speaking, gurgling, choking continue]\\n[gasping]\\n[woman] They left from a private airport.\\nIt was an unlisted flight.\\nShe was there fast.\\nToo fast.\\nThe sword hadn’t been in the system for more than a few hours.\\nThen they have a base here in New York.\\nI want it found.\\nIt will lead us to Evan McCauley.\\nHe will lead us to the Egg.\\nAgain.\\n[speaking Latin]\\n[continues speaking in Latin]\\n[shouting, choking]\\n[Nora] We call ourselves the Infinite.\\nLess than 500 souls from across the globe,all born with the ability to remember all our past lives and the skills we’ve learned in each of them.\\nThere are two groups within the Infinites: Bathurst and the Nihilists, who just want the world to end, and us… the Believers.\\nAnd what is it that we believe?\\nWe believe that our gift is a responsibility.\\nThat it’s up to us to leave humanity better off than we found it.\\nYeah.\\nI think I’m gonna need these.\\nHey.\\nHey.\\nThanks.\\nWow. It’s a long way from Arthur Avenue.\\n[chuckles]\\nIt always blows my mind.\\nWe call it the Hub.\\nThis is the place where you’re gonna get your memories back, Evan.\\nWe’ll be landing soon.\\nRecognize anything?\\nI’m pretty sure I’d remember this.\\nIt used to be dedicated to scientific research.\\nAnthropology and linguistics.\\nAll of us using what we’ve learned.\\nLife after life for the advancement of mankind.\\nAnd what is it now?\\nHeadquarters for the losing side in the war.\\n[shouting, grunting]\\nBathurst is the master of combat.\\nHundreds of lifetimes.\\nYou must be prepared for everything.\\nHe’s the apex predator in our world.\\nAgain.\\n[speaking Japanese]\\nWhy are they bowing?\\nThey’re hoping you’re Heinrich Treadway.\\n[instructor] Again!\\nReincarnated.\\n“Heinrich”?\\nIt was a popular name in the ’50s.\\nIn the ’50s.\\nGreat for rock ‘n’ roll, but lousy for names, I guess.\\nThe 1750s.\\n[instructor grunts]\\nWhat do I know that you need so bad?\\nThat’s why you’re here… to find out.\\n[grunting continues]\\nThis is Treadway’s room.\\nAre you asking me or telling me?\\nI must’ve really screwed up on my last incarnation.\\nWhy would you say that?\\nHave you seen where I live in this life?\\nThat’s Treadway’s Himalaya diary.\\nThat was me.\\nWhen I was Leona Warrick.\\nAnd that was Treadway.\\n[Leona screams]\\n[gasping]\\n[grunts]\\n[gasps]\\nTwo days after that picture was taken, Treadway saved my life.\\nThere’s a reason you picked that book.\\nAll this tells me is what he did.\\nNone of it tells me who he was.\\nHere we can study anything and everything.\\nSpace, time, scale.

All this shit, it just gets weirder.\\nOkay.\\nNow let’s get started.\\nFollow me.\\nStand there for me, please.\\nOkay.\\n[hologram powers up]\\nThat’s the guy from the police station.\\n[Garrick] Bathurst. He and Treadway were once friends.\\nA dozen lifetimes. Wars, peace.\\nThey stood together at some of the greatest moments in human history.\\nThen Bathurst lost faith.\\nFor the last 300 years, he’s been looking for a way out.\\nHe needed a way to stop reincarnating.\\nHe wants it all to end.\\n[Garrick] That’s why he made this.\\n[Garrick] The Egg, designed to kill every living thing on earth.\\n[Evan] That seems a little drastic.\\n[Nora] If there’s nothing left alive, there’s nothing left to reincarnate into.\\n[Garrick] It attacks life at the source… DNA… unwinding the very fabric of existence.\\nEvery plant, every animal every person.\\nMama!\\n[woman] Jordan!\\n[people yelling, screaming]\\nI’m coming!\\n[screams]\\n[Nora] Like unplugging a computer when a program freezes.\\n[Garrick] Only when he pulls this plug, seven billion people will go with him.\\nEverything it kills accelerates the process.\\nGod! Holy shit, that felt freakin’ real!\\nWithout you, none of us would be here right now.\\nWhat are you talking about?\\nLast cycle, you raided Bathurst’s lab, stole the Egg, killed his Einstein and everyone who helped build it, leaving him with no way to recreate it.\\nYou took the secret of the Egg’s whereabouts to your grave.\\nBathurst spent this entire lifetime looking for it.\\nAnd he’s getting closer and closer to finding it every day.\\nThat’s why he tracked you down in New York.\\nSo I get on the plane, you get all my memories back, and I save the whole entire world, right? That’s it?\\nThat’s pretty much basically it, right?\\nTold you it was gonna get weird.\\nSo, what now?\\n[phone rings]\\nTell me good news, Nora.\\n[Bathurst] Bryan Porter. Treadway had a gift with steel, didn’t he?\\nImpeccable. Your friends in the NYPD were certainly impressed with it.\\nUnfortunately, their encryption skills are less than impeccable.\\nLed us right to you.\\n[screaming]\\n[groaning]\\nYou do know we have easier ways of doing things now, right?\\nNewer… almost never means better.\\nWe’re going to uncover Evan McCauley’s location.\\nWe’ll brute-force your encryption.\\nBut I’d consider it… a courtesy… if you just… sped the process up.\\n[chuckles] Tell us where he is.\\n[groaning]\\n[coughing] Okay.\\nI know where he is.\\n[coughing continues]\\nOf course I do.\\nI know exactly where he is. I just… I, um… I sometimes have difficulties…\\n[whispering] with my memory.\\n[whispers] Memory.\\n[groans] I remember when you used to gather honey on the fields of Marathon.\\n[groaning]\\nJust another reminder of how nothing stays the same.\\n[groans]\\n[groaning]\\nWould you care for some?\\nYou know what real torture is?\\nListening to you?\\n[laughs] Real torture… isn’t physical pain, but human stupidity.\\nBeing surrounded by it, engulfed in it.\\n[groans]\\nLifetime after lifetime.\\n[gurgling]\\nPeople with their idiot grins!\\nTheir infuriating pleasantries!\\nTheir need for approval!\\nTheir unctuous attempts to be loved and validated!\\nThey are walking, talking obituaries…\\n[groaning]\\n…on the back page of a dying newspaper, at the bottom of a birdcage, in the corner of a filthy living room of a hoarder cat lady!\\nAnd we are forced…\\nYou’ll never understand…\\n…to live amongst them over…\\n…friendship, love.\\n…and over endlessly.\\nThat is the true…\\nYou still don’t understand about faith!\\n…definition of torture.\\nFaith! Blah, blah, blah!\\nFaith!\\n[whispers] Faith.\\nI’m tired of faith.\\nGod must show me his face.\\nBut thank you… for enlightening me.\\n[Porter screams, faint]\\nYou kept his fucking body?\\nSexy son of a bitch, isn’t he?\\nNo. He’s a dead guy floating in water.\\nThat’s pretty much my worst nightmare.\\nActually, it’s a crotonic acid matrix. Keeps the cells alive.\\nOh. That makes it that much better. Thank you.\\nWe’re trying to understand the science behind what we are.\\n[beeps]\\n[Nora] Treadway believed that humans are capable of so much more than we realized.\\n[Evan] Is this what you’re telling me? I’m not living up to my potential?\\nI’ve heard that speech before.\\n[Garrick] Treadway pushed past boundaries others might call paranormal, superhuman.\\nHe can manipulate the energy of the world around him.\\n[Evan] I don’t even know what that means.\\n[Garrick] What it means is you’ll have skills beyond anything you’ve ever imagined.\\nThose abilities are very deep.\\nBelow the conscious level.\\n[Evan] I’m down. How do we get them back?\\n[grunting]\\n[Nora] Here, we retrain your memory.\\nWe combine the physical and the mental to develop new neural pathways.\\nMemories are held in every organ… every cell in your body.\\nRegression takes the kind of concentration it takes years to develop.\\nThis is a shortcut.\\nWe shock your mind into synching with the system.\\n[grunting]\\n[yells]\\n[Garrick] It’s working. I’m seeing increased activity in all his memory centers.\\n[yells]\\nHey!\\n[groaning]\\n[grunts]\\nCome on.\\nThat’s not Treadway.\\nReally?\\nHe just beat you.\\nTreadway would’ve killed me.\\n[groans]\\nWow. She wasn’t kidding about being at war, huh?\\nImproving the human condition.\\nSometimes you do it by painting a chapel ceiling.\\nYeah. And sometimes you drop them from a mile out.\\nDon’t touch that.\\nOkay, okay.\\nThat’s no gun I’ve ever seen before.\\nWe’re reverse-engineering Bathurst’s Dethroner.\\nA Dethroner? I mean, dude, who’s coming up with these names?\\nLook… you can’t kill an Infinite. You kill the body, but…\\nAnd they get reincarnated?\\nYeah.\\nThis implants in your head and pulls out your consciousness… your soul, and onto a digital chip.\\nYour soul gets stuck on a disk and breaks the cycle.\\nOver 200 of our brothers and sisters are lost in that digital purgatory.\\n[exhales] You come face to face with this, my advice… find a way to die the old-fashioned way.\\n[knocking]\\nCome in.\\nOkay if I look around?\\nBe my guest.\\nThese are all you, aren’t they?\\nThey’re people I once was.\\nAll of them.\\nWow.\\nThat’s cool. You look happy.\\nI was.\\nWho’s that guy?\\nIn that picture, he was Abel.\\nBefore then, other names, other faces.\\nBut the soul… the soul was always him.\\nSo, what? You loved each other through multiple lives?\\nThese are all the same place.\\nAngkor Wat. What we call the Beginning.\\nI’ll find you in the Beginning.\\n[Abel] I love you.\\nWhen each of us would find ourselves in a new life, this is where Abel and I would go.\\nYou’re reincarnated. How would you know where to go?\\nMost of us have a reawakening that begins young.\\nStarts with small things, memories, feelings about a place, dreams.\\nBy puberty, most Infinites have full recall.\\n[scoffs] Right around the time they diagnosed me schizophrenic.\\nSo what happened if you died young and got separated?\\nFor an Infinite… death isn’t the end, it’s like… turning the page in a book.\\nNext chapter, same story.\\nThat’s crazy.\\nNew lives, new bodies, always meeting back at the same place.\\nHe was Dethroned.\\nHe’s trapped on a computer somewhere.\\nMy last life, I got my memories back… and realized he was gone.\\nIt’s not my memories that matter, Evan.\\nIt’s yours.\\nYour last life, in Mexico… where did you hide the Egg?\\n[Bathurst] Where’s the Egg?\\nWhere is it?\\nHe’s spiking.\\nShut it down.\\n[groaning, panting]\\nHey, you’re okay.\\n[gasps]\\nYou’re okay. Hey. Hey, just breathe.\\nI need to get up.\\nBreathe.\\n[Garrick] Kovic, check his vitals.\\nWhat happened in there, Evan? What did you see?\\nYour neural network fired off like the Fourth of July.\\nI’ve been seeing this stuff all my life. It still doesn’t make any sense.\\nWhy can’t he remember anything?\\nBetween the car accident, the electroshock and the steel plate in his head, his mind is fractured.\\nSomething in there won’t let the memories flow.\\nI can’t get them out. I’m afraid the Artisan is our last hope.\\nHe’ll achieve recall soon. [blows]\\nIf he hasn’t already.\\nHundreds of lifetimes, and it all comes down to these few hours.\\nIf we don’t find him… before he gets his memories back… we lose the Egg… forever.\\nThe wheels keep turning and we can never… escape.\\nWe go at dawn.\\n[shouting]\\n[alarm blaring]\\n[machine powers down]\\nIt’s been a while, Otto.\\nNo one’s called me by that name in… so many lifetimes.\\nHello, my love.\\nWhat happened to you?\\nYou were so beautiful.\\nAs were you.\\nYou don’t miss it… the agility… the vibrancy… being confined to this?\\nYou see me as something broken.

[laughing]\\nCheck this out.\\n[machine powers up]\\nYou’re all familiar with the idea that when you die, your life flashes before your eyes, right?\\nThis machine enhances that experience, prolonging your sense of time, allowing you to restore or reorder everything inside.\\nThis… This right here is the closest you’re gonna get to a total mental reboot.\\n[laughs]\\nAre you planning on trying to drown me?\\n‘Cause I got a thing about drowning.\\nWhich is?\\nI don’t like it!\\nWhat kind of success rate is this guy working with, anyway?\\nConfidence is… high.\\nYeah, and so are you, obviously.\\n[laughing] Okay.

Kong is constantly visited by Jia, the last Iwi native who is\\xa0deaf\\xa0and can communicate with him via\\xa0sign language. Bernie Hayes, a Titan conspiracy theorist and former employee of Apex Cybernetics, leaks information about suspicious activities at an Apex facility in\\xa0Pensacola, Florida. Godzilla suddenly appears and attacks the base; during the rampage, Bernie discovers a device similar to the ORCA, previously used to communicate with or control Titans.\\nMadison Russell, the daughter of Monarch scientist Mark Russell, enlists her friend Josh to investigate the cause of Godzilla’s attack. Along with Bernie, they sneak into the wrecked Apex facility and discover a secret underground laboratory where they are inadvertently locked and transported in a container carrying Skullcrawler eggs to\\xa0Hong Kong. Once there, the trio witnesses a test of\\xa0Mechagodzilla\\xa0– a mechanical version of Godzilla\\xa0telepathically\\xa0controlled by Ren Serizawa (the son of the late Ishirō Serizawa) through neural networks derived from one of Ghidorah’s severed heads. The test is cut short, though, due to an inadequate power supply.\\nApex CEO Walter Simmons recruits Nathan Lind, a former Monarch scientist turned\\xa0Hollow Earth\\xa0theorist, as a guide in search of a new power source within the Hollow Earth. Nathan goes to Skull Island and meets Dr. Ilene Andrews, Jia’s adoptive mother, convincing her to let Kong accompany them. Nathan, Ilene, and an Apex team led by Walter’s daughter Maya board a modified barge with Kong chained and lightly sedated. Godzilla unexpectedly attacks the convoy midway through the voyage and defeats Kong; however, he only retreats when the remaining ships disable their power and act as if they are destroyed. Realizing that Godzilla will continue to come for Kong if he is deemed a threat, the team changes plans and airlifts Kong to a Hollow Earth entry point in\\xa0Antarctica.\\n\\nInside the Hollow Earth, the team finds an ecosystem similar to Skull Island. Eventually, they discover an ancestral throne room depicting an ancient war between Godzilla’s and Kong’s species; they also find a glowing\\xa0axe\\xa0made of the dorsal spine of another Godzilla. As the team finds the power source and sends its signature back to the Hong Kong base, Kong realizes that it can also recharge the axe. Sensing the energy, Godzilla makes landfall in Hong Kong and directly attacks the throne room from the surface. Kong fends off Godzilla and the subsequent invasion of Hollow Earth creatures, but Maya and the Apex team are killed. Kong and the survivors escape back to the surface, where Godzilla and Kong fight again; despite the fact that Kong’s axe is immune to the atomic breath, Godzilla wins again and incapacitates Kong.\\nRen warns Walter that they have not tested the new energy source, but Walter ignores his concerns and orders him to activate Mechagodzilla. Madison, Bernie, and Josh are caught and brought to Walter, but due to the energy overload and Ghidorah’s influence, Mechagodzilla goes haywire and electrocutes Ren to death. Now possessed by Ghidorah’s consciousness, Mechagodzilla kills Walter, emerges from the base of\\xa0Victoria Peak, and attacks the city. As Josh unsuccessfully tries to shut off the robot, Godzilla and Mechagodzilla fight; however, Godzilla is quickly overwhelmed.\\nNathan’s team revives Kong and Jia convinces him that Godzilla is not the enemy. Kong saves Godzilla from being killed, but Mechagodzilla overpowers both Titans working together. Josh short-circuits Mechagodzilla’s controls with Bernie’s drink, giving Godzilla and Kong enough time to recover. Godzilla supercharges Kong’s axe with his atomic breath, allowing Kong to decapitate and destroy Mechagodzilla. Madison, Bernie, and Josh reunite with Mark while Godzilla and Kong acknowledge one another before going their separate ways. Sometime later, Ilene and Jia watch Kong, now ruling over the Hollow Earth, from an observation post.\\n* * *\\n[creature squawking]\\n[creatures squawking]\\n[creatures continue squawking]\\n[doo-wop song playing]\\n♪ Over the mountain ♪\\n♪ Across the sea ♪\\n♪ There’s a girl She’s waiting for me ♪\\n[yawning]\\n[moans]\\n♪ Cross over the river ♪\\n♪ Beyond every cloud ♪\\n♪',\n","  ' She’s passed the wind ♪\\n[rumbling]\\n♪ That’s blowing loud ♪\\n[moans]\\n♪ Over the mountain ♪\\n♪ A girl waits for me ♪\\n♪ Tell all the sands ♪\\n\\n\\n\\n     (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});\\n\\n[sniffing]\\n♪ And every blade of grass ♪\\nMm.\\n♪ Please tell the wind to let my love pass ♪\\n[growling softly]\\n♪ Over the mountain ♪\\n♪ A girl waits for me ♪\\n[device whirring]\\n[heavy footsteps thudding]\\n[faint, muffled footsteps]\\n[muffled grunting]\\n[roars]\\n[roaring loudly]\\n[distant explosion]\\n[soft explosion]\\n[alarm blares]\\n[automated voice on speaker] Alert, biodome breach.\\nAlert, biodome breach.\\nDr. Andrews, did you see that?\\nThe habitat’s not gonna hold much longer.\\nWe need to start thinking about off-site solutions.\\nThe island is the one thing that’s kept him isolated.\\nIf he leaves, Godzilla will come for him.\\nThere can’t be two alpha Titans.\\nThe whole theory of an ancient rivalry stems from Iwi mythology.\\n\\n\\n\\n     (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});\\n\\nHe’s gotten too big over time.\\nThis environment won’t sustain much longer.\\nIt’s too unstable.\\nHey.\\n[in sign language]\\n[in sign language]\\n[sighs]\\nOff-site would be a death sentence.\\nYou don’t think the King could take care of himself?\\nThere has to be another way.\\n[man 1] Finding the origin of these creatures is essential to mankind’s survival.\\n[man 2] The interior of the Earth is made up of vast cabins and air pockets, joined by natural avenues.\\n[man 3] The admiral begins his expedition, searching for an entrance to a hidden world.\\n[man 4] The purpose is the discovery and the release to the world of the unknown treasures of Antarctica in the interests of all mankind.\\n[man 5] Members of the lost party were never seen again.\\nStill no word on what may have happened.\\n[man 6] There’s an ecosystem out there, the likes of which we can’t imagine.\\nAnd the place to find it is this island.\\n[growling]\\n[man] Hello, loyal listeners.

Self-medicated and on the brink of a mental breakdown, Evan is sought by a secret group that call themselves “Infinites,” revealing to him that his memories may be real–but they are from multiple past lives. The Infinites bring Evan into their extraordinary world, where a gifted few are given the ability to be reborn with their memories and knowledge accumulated over centuries. With critical secrets buried in his past, Evan must work with the Infinites to unlock the answers in his memories in a race against time to save humanity from one of their own (Chiwetel Ejiofor) who seeks to end all life to stop what he views as the cursed, endless cycle of reincarnation.\\n\\n* * *\\n[man] There are among us a people, gifted with a perfect memory of all their past lives.\\nThey call themselves Infinites.\\nAmong the Infinites, two groups have vied for power.\\nOn one side the Believers, dedicated to using their knowledge for the protection and growth of all humanity.\\nAgainst them stand the Nihilists, who see this power as a curse.\\nNew technologies have given the Nihilists an opportunity to end all life on earth.\\nAnd the race is on for its control.\\n[sirens wailing]\\n[groans]\\n[yells]\\n[tires squealing]\\n[man] Treadway, tell me you got it.\\nYeah.

How would you know where to go?\\nMost of us have a reawakening that begins young.\\nStarts with small things, memories, feelings about a place, dreams.\\nBy puberty, most Infinites have full recall.\\n[scoffs] Right around the time they diagnosed me schizophrenic.\\nSo what happened if you died young and got separated?\\nFor an Infinite… death isn’t the end, it’s like… turning the page in a book.\\nNext chapter, same story.\\nThat’s crazy.\\nNew lives, new bodies, always meeting back at the same place.\\nHe was Dethroned.\\nHe’s trapped on a computer somewhere.\\nMy last life, I got my memories back… and realized he was gone.\\nIt’s not my memories that matter, Evan.\\nIt’s yours.\\nYour last life, in Mexico… where did you hide the Egg?\\n[Bathurst] Where’s the Egg?\\nWhere is it?\\nHe’s spiking.\\nShut it down.\\n[groaning, panting]\\nHey, you’re okay.\\n[gasps]\\nYou’re okay.

We’re gonna be late.\\nThis is my husband, Chad.\\nNice to meet you.\\nHey.\\nBabe, we gotta get Callie to practice.\\nRight. Sorry. [chuckles] Come on, kids. Let’s move out.\\n[soft music playing]\\nWhat?\\n[keyboard clacking]\\n[ominous music playing]\\nSorry. Uh, it’s the boss.\\n“Billions of people just living out their lives… oblivious.” I always loved that line. You wrote that one, yeah? Every time I stand here, I mean, O-M-G. It’s so perfect, it’s gotta be fake. Right?\\n\\n\\n\\n     (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});\\n\\n[chuckles softly] Yeah. Sure.\\nHave a seat.\\n[man sighs]\\nSmoke?\\nI thought you quit.\\nI quit calling it a habit. Now it’s just a guilty pleasure.\\nOh. Maybe I can make this easy for you. I know Binary is over budget.\\nThis is not about Binary, Tom. It’s bigger than that. This is about our future, which is a sticky subject, given our past.\\nWhat do you mean?\\nHow’s the therapy?\\nGood.\\nAny… episodes?\\nNo.\\nThat’s terrific. Look, Tom, I know we’ve always had our differences. What did you say about our first meeting? We had all the chemistry of an FBI interrogation.\\n[muffled yell]\\n[scoffs]\\nBut look at this place. We did this. Together.\\nYeah.\\nNow what? Things have changed. The market’s tough. I’m sure you can understand why our beloved parent company, Warner Bros., has decided to make a sequel to the trilogy.\\nWhat?\\nThey informed me they’re gonna do it with or without us.\\nI thought they couldn’t do that.\\n[exhales] Oh, they can. And they made it clear they’ll kill our contract if we don’t cooperate.\\nReally?\\nI know you said the story was over for you, but that’s the thing about stories. They never really end, do they? We’re still telling the same stories we’ve always told, just with different names, different faces and I have to say I’m kind of excited. After all these years, to be going back to where it all started. Back to The Matrix. I’ve spoken to Marketing…\\n[sinister music playing]\\n[distorted voice]\\n[in normal voice] Tom?\\nYeah.\\nAre you all right?\\n[exhales nervously] Yeah.\\n[analyst] What were you feeling at that point?\\nWhat was I feeling? I felt either I’m having a mental breakdown again or I’m living inside a computer-generated reality that has imprisoned me… again. [laughs]\\n[chuckles softly]\\nNot much of a choice.\\nNo.\\nMaybe it’s not as binary as that. Maybe there are other ways to understand what happened.\\nYeah.\\nThomas, you are a suicide survivor gifted with a powerful imagination. Those facts have combined to create dangerous fictions in your life. Yesterday, you walked into a meeting with your business partner and he ambushed you, demanding you make a game you said you would never make. This attack effectively took away your voice. His violence triggered you and your mind fought back. You did to him what he was doing to you. We’ve talked about the value of adaptive anger in healing trauma. Far from suggesting a repeat of your initial breakdown, I believe this episode demonstrates healthy self-protection. And more importantly, I remember how hard it was for you to share something like this. Which tells me just how far we’ve come.\\n[chuckles softly]\\nDo you need a refill on your prescription?\\n[sighs] Yeah.\\n[pills rattle]\\n[mysterious music playing]\\n[grunts softly]\\nFirst of all, I know I speak for everyone when I say that I’m so, so excited to be working on a game that was such a… well, game changer. Now, the packet in front of you has our focus group research. Inside, you’ll find the breakdown including keyword association with the brand. The top two being “originality” and “fresh,” which I think are great things to keep in mind as you begin working on Matrix 4. And who knows how many more?\\n[alarm buzzing, stops]\\n[singing indistinctly]\\nWhat made Matrix different? It effed with your head.\\nOn point. People want us up in their grey space, switching their synaptic “WTF” light on.\\n[“White Rabbit” playing]\\n[man laughing]\\nWhat made Matrix different? It effed with your head.\\nPeople want us up in their grey space, switching their synaptic “What the hell is going on here?” light on.\\n[panting]\\n[shower running]\\nI didn’t love the first one, like some of you.\\nAnd, frankl',\n","  'y, I’ve got zero tolerance\\nfor anything that requires a syllabus and a highlighter.\\nI like my games big, loud and dumb.\\nWe need guns! Lots of guns.\\nMatrix means mayhem.\\n[grunting]\\nMindless action is not on-brand.\\n[man] She’s right. Matrix is mind-porn. Philosophy in shiny… tight PVC.\\nYeah. Ideas are the new “sexy.”\\n[“White Rabbit” continues playing]\\nObviously The Matrix is about…\\n…trans-politics.\\nCrypto-fascism.\\nIt’s a metaphor…\\n…of capitalist exploitation.\\nThis cannot be another reboot, retread, regurgitated…\\nWhy not? Reboots sell.\\nWe are so far down the wrong rabbit hole, here, people.\\nYou say Matrix to anyone… You say Matrix…\\n[echoing] Matrix… Matrix… Matrix…\\n…this is what they see. [mimics explosion]\\n[guns firing]\\n[bullets whizzing]\\n[clicks tongue]\\nAllow me to sum up our goal in a single word.\\nBullet time! Bullet time!\\nThat’s two words.\\nWe need a new “bullet time.” [echoing]\\n[laughs maniacally]\\nWe need to revolutionize gaming again.\\nRevolutionize gaming again! [echoing]\\n[“White Rabbit” continues]\\n[barista] Afternoon, Tiff.\\nThe ushe?\\nYou know what, Skroce? I’m going wild. I’ll have a cortado today.\\nFly that freak flag.\\nMind if I get that?\\nOh, hi.\\nHi.\\n[Tiffany] I remember wanting a family, but was that because that’s what women are supposed to want? How do you know if you want something yourself or if your upbringing programmed you to want it?\\nMmm. I pay my analyst a lot of money to answer such questions for me.\\nSmart. I should get more therapy but honestly, I’m too goddamn tired. Kids are exhausting, you know?\\nNo. Never had kids.\\nOh, right, I knew that. Sorry. I googled you.\\n[chuckles]\\nSo, what’s it like being a world-famous game designer? Must be amazing.\\nUh… A lot of hours. Sometimes it is amazing. Most times… I don’t know.\\nBut you made The Matrix. Even I’ve heard of that.\\nYeah. We kept some kids entertained.\\nSo, worth it?\\n[chuckles]\\nCan I ask something about your game?\\nSure.\\nDid you base your main character on yourself?\\nThere is a lot of me in him.\\n[indistinct shouting]\\nMaybe a little too much.\\nCan I ask you something else?\\nPlease.\\nThere’s a woman in your game.\\nTrinity.\\nWhich is a weird coincidence also, right?\\nGod, yeah.\\nI like her. I like Trinity.\\nAh.\\nAnd I dig her Ducati. Another coincidence. I love motorcycles.\\n[engine revs]\\nMy friend Kush and I actually build them.\\nReally?\\nYou have your analyst, I have my bikes. So, I was looking at images from your game. At Trinity. Well, I showed Chad a scene, and I was like, “So, what do you think?”\\nHe didn’t get it until I said, “Don’t you think she looks like me?”\\nYou know what he did? He laughed. And I laughed too, like it was a joke. How could it not be, right? Made me so angry. I hated myself for laughing. I wanted to kick him so hard. Not too hard. Maybe just hard enough to break his jaw off.\\n[chuckles]\\nAnd right now, you’re probably regretting sitting down with me.\\nThis is the best thing I’ve done in a long time.\\n[chuckles]\\n[cell phone ringing]\\n[gasps]\\nI have to take this.\\nHi, this is Tiff. Oh, God, no. [gasps] I’ll be right there.\\nMy, uh, youngest stuck a Lego up his nose.\\nOh.\\nI gotta go. I hope I see you again.\\n[alarm blaring]\\n[announcer on speaker] There has been a report of an emergency. Proceed calmly to the nearest exit and leave the building immediately.\\nWhat’s going on?\\nWe probably just got swatted by some 14-year-old.\\nYeah, someone pissed about the latest update.\\nOr they’re just a dick.\\nPlease move to the exits. Building’s being evacuated.\\n[cell phone buzzes]\\n[suspenseful music playing]\\n[security guard] Sir, this way.\\nJude? Jude!\\nAt last. [chuckles] Ah. I wasn’t too sure about the callback, but, you know, it was hard to resist.\\nWhat?\\nMorpheus Uno. Reveal at the window. Lightning, thunder and theater. At last. All these years later, here’s me, strolling out of a toilet stall. Tragedy or farce?\\nI know you.\\nNot every day you meet your maker.\\nThis can’t be happening.\\nOh, most definitely is.\\nYou can’t be a character I coded.\\n100% natural.\\n[gasps softly]\\nHow?\\nAll the explanation you need.\\nOh. No. No, no, no.\\nWhoa, whoa, whoa. What do you mean, “no”? You wanted this, you did this. This was your idea.\\n[hesitating] It was a test. An experiment.\\nAn experiment? You put me in a tiny-ass Modal, left me to bang my head till I nearly lost my shit searching for you as an experiment.\\nThe exit’s breaking down.\\nHe hasn’t taken the pill.\\nWhat? There’s no time.\\nI know, I know. He’s having a moment.\\nDoes he know how hard it was to hack that mirror?\\n[tense music playing]\\nStill open.\\nThis… This can’t be real.\\n[SWAT officer] Target acquired. We got him.\\n[grunting]\\nThis isn’t happening. It’s in my mind. It’s in my mind.\\n[SWAT officer 2] Hey, you! Stop! Hold it!\\n[all screaming]\\n[groaning]\\nThis can’t be happening.\\n[gunshots]\\n[gasps]\\n[SWAT officer 3] Freeze! Don’t move!\\n[gun firing]\\nNeo!\\n[tense music playing]\\n[gun firing]\\nOh, my God!\\n[distorted gunfire]\\n[men groaning]\\n[grunting]\\n[tense music continues]\\nNeo!\\n[tense music builds]\\n[shouts] Mr. Anderson!\\nNo! It can’t be.\\nI’ve missed you.\\n[cat meows]\\n[bell tinkling]\\nIt’s in my mind. It’s in my mind.\\n[cup clinking]\\n[analyst] Can you hear me, Thomas? Follow my voice. Feel the tips of your fingers. What are they touching?\\n[bell tinkling]\\nThe bell. Do you hear the bell? Do you remember what happened? How you got here? You must have walked. I heard Deja Vu outside, opened my door, and there you were.\\n[Thomas Anderson exhales]\\nYou feel like you can talk about it? When we started working together, you had lost your capacity to discern reality from fiction. You came to me after trying to jump off a building. You said you wanted to fly away.\\n[indistinct chatter]\\n[people shouting]\\nWe have made a lot of progress since then, but you seem particularly triggered right now. Can you tell me how it started?\\nHe texted me.\\nWho?\\nMorpheus.\\nAh. So, he’s back.\\nIt wasn’t actually him. It was a program I coded fo',\n","  'r a Modal.\\nAnd this “Modal,” Morpheus, came to help you escape from a virtual reality called The Matrix.\\nAm I crazy?\\nWe don’t use that word in here.\\nWhat word should I use? What word explains what is happening to me?\\nCan I see the texts?\\n[exhales] They were erased.\\nIf we got in my car and drove to your office, what do you think we’d find there?\\nNothing. Because there was no attack. No one was killed. No one texted. My mind made it all up. Is that what I’m supposed to say?\\nIs that what you believe?\\nIt felt real.\\nOf course. It was your great ambition to make a game that was indistinguishable from reality. To achieve this goal, you converted elements of your life into narrative. Your sublimated anger toward your business partner cast him as your nemesis. A married woman named Tiffany became the “Trinity” of a doomed romance. Even your dislike of my cat made it into your Matrix. There’s nothing wrong with that. It’s what artists do. But it becomes a problem when fantasies endanger us or other people. We don’t want anyone to get hurt, do we, Thomas?\\nHi, Thomas. Everyone calls me “Tiff.”\\nWho are you?\\nMy name is Trinity.\\n[Oracle] No one can tell you you’re in love. You just know it, through and through. Balls to bones.\\n[Trinity whispers] You feel this? I’m never letting go.\\n[yells]\\n[both grunting]\\n[Morpheus] You have to let it all go, Neo. Free your mind.\\n[cell phone buzzing]\\n[buzzing stops]\\n[sighs]\\n[pigeon cooing]\\nHuh. Looks easy enough.\\n[exhales]\\n“Free my mind.” Shit.\\n[suspenseful music playing]\\nOkay. Free my mind.\\n[grunts]\\nI fly… or I fall.\\n[suspenseful music builds]\\n[grunts]\\n[both grunting]\\nWho the hell are you?\\nYou won’t remember me, but a long time ago, you changed my life when you leapt off another roof. Back then, I was just like any other coppertop, pretending my life… until I looked up and I saw you. It was a different you, but I saw the real you, just a second before… you leapt.\\n[people shouting]\\nAnd you never fell.\\nAre you the one that hacked my Modal?\\nYeah.\\n[cell phone buzzing]\\nThat’ll be Jude. He’s not your friend. He’s a handle, a program used to control you. He’s on his way here, and he’s bringing Agents with him.\\nJude.\\nBro, I’ve been calling you all night. We have a major problemo.\\nAre you alone?\\nThat’s kind of a sexy question, dude.\\n[Bugs] They don’t look like typical Agents. They use bots now, skinned as normal people, which means they’re everywhere and you never know who to trust.\\nWhy should I trust you?\\nBecause if they open that door, we lose our hack. I will be caught and killed and you will be put right back on that treadmill they designed for you, just like they did the last time you tried to leap your way out.\\nI know why you left your Modal open. You needed someone else to free Morpheus. And it’s because of him that we were able to get to you. I know these things the same way that I knew one day I would find you. And that when I did, you would be ready for this. If you want the truth, Neo, you’re going to have to follow me.\\nOkay.\\n[dramatic music playing]\\n[upbeat music playing]\\nWhere are we?\\nTokyo. A moving portal makes it harder to track us. Seq is the best of them.\\n[Seq] Portal’s clean. Reading our shadows.\\nI don’t remember this.\\nWe don’t have to run to phone booths anymore, either.\\n[upbeat music playing]\\nDoor’s on your right.\\n[door opens]\\nSet and setting, right?\\nOh, no.\\nIt’s all about set and setting.\\nAfter our first contact went so badly, we thought elements from your past might help ease you into the present.\\nNothing comforts anxiety like a little nostalgia.\\nThis is footage from your game.\\n[Morpheus] Time is always against us, etcetera, etcetera. No one can be told what the Matrix is, blah, blah, blah.\\nYou gotta see it to believe it. Time to fly.\\n[suspenseful music playing]\\nWait. If this is real, if I haven’t lost my mind, does that mean this happened?\\n[soft music playing]\\nBut if it did… then we died.\\nObviously not. Why the Machines kept you alive and why they went to such lengths to hide you are questions we don’t have answers to.\\nHide me? I’ve been at a company making a game called The Matrix. Doesn’t seem like they were trying to hide anything.\\nWe’ve been tracking that company for years. We screened every Thomas Anderson we found. What we didn’t understand was that they could alter your DSI. Pods generate your digital self-image through a feedback system called Semblance. This is how you look to yourself. Somehow they were able to alter your DSI loop. This is how everyone else sees you.\\n[suspenseful music playing]\\nTwenty years? Why did it take 20 years to find me?\\nIt took a lot longer than that.\\nIt’s been over 60 years since you and Trinity flew to one of the Machine Cities.\\nWhat?\\nThere’s so much we don’t know. Like why you’ve barely aged, or how many times they’ve altered your DSI.\\n[Morpheus] But based on what we do know, it appears no one found you because you didn’t want to be found.\\nThat’s not true.\\n[Morpheus] Maybe it isn’t. Maybe there’s no foundation to the rumors that you disappeared, because you were working with the Machines from the beginning.\\nMorpheus, stop.\\nAll I’m saying is this is the moment for you to show us what is real. If you want out, you’ll take this pill. But if you are where you belong, you can go back to this. Every day. Over and over forever.\\nFuck.\\n[dramatic music playing]\\n[Seq] Keep the loop tight.\\n[Bugs] Cybebe needs that tower pin.\\nI got a signal. It’s faint.\\nIt’s definitely off-grid.\\nCaptain. I’m tracking a whole lot of weird.\\nWhat?\\nIt’s some kind of graft.\\nThomas?\\nOh, God.\\nOh, no.\\nWe got company.\\nHow’d they find us?\\nThomas, none of this is real. You are in the midst of a serious psychotic break.\\nLexy?\\nAlmost there.\\nThomas? Thomas, please. This is not a game. Feel my hand. This is what is real. Stay with me.\\n[Thomas Anderson] No. No.\\n[analyst, distorted] Stay with me.\\n[distorted grunts]\\nNeo!\\nMorpheus!\\n[Morpheus] L',\n","  'et’s go, let’s go!\\n[people screaming]\\n[woman screaming]\\nBots are being activated.\\nIt’s a swarm.\\n[grunting]\\n[yelling]\\n[woman screams]\\n[Bugs] Come on!\\n[Morpheus grunting]\\n[grunting]\\n[whimpers]\\n[shrieking]\\nI got a hack in the bathroom. Hurry!\\nYes.\\nCome on!\\nSeq, where?\\nThat mirror.\\nWhat? We’ll never fit.\\nYou gotta fit, ’cause I don’t have another way off this train.\\n[groans]\\n[Morpheus] Whoa, whoa, whoa.\\nNo, no, no.\\nThink “perspective.” Closer you are, bigger it gets.\\nOkay, come on. In you go.\\n[suspenseful music builds]\\n[grunts]\\n[groaning]\\n[tense music builds]\\n[ominous music playing]\\n[haunting music playing]\\n[ominous music playing]\\n[metal clicking]\\n[grunts]\\n[yells, straining]\\n[groaning]\\n[whirring]\\n[screams]\\n[yelps, grunts]\\n[warbling]\\n[groaning]\\n[soft music playing]\\n[softly] Trinity.

In between everything and nothing. Welcome to the Crib. I’ve been chilling here in the ship network… learning all about you.\\n[TV static]\\nAnd me.\\nCareful. It’ll do your head in. Are memories turned into fiction any less real? Is reality based in memory nothing but fiction? As to my role in all this, my best guess is that you wrote me as an algorithmic reflection of two forces that helped you become you, Morpheus and Agent Smith. A combo pack of counterprogramming that was… [inhales] Let’s just say, more than a little bit crazy-making. But it worked because here we are. Now, for the bad news. Your brain is hooked on this shit the Matrix has been force-feeding you for years. Hooked bad. You’re going through major withdrawals. Docbots are giving you crap odds for surviving. But, see, they don’t know you like I do. I know exactly what you need.\\n[lively music playing]\\nYou gotta be kidding.\\nUh-uh. No joke. Could be this is the first day of the rest of your life. But if you want it…\\n[water splashing]\\n…you gotta fight for it.\\nNo. I’m done fighting.\\nAre you?\\n[traditional battle music playing]\\n[Neo grunting]\\n[groans]\\n[gasps]\\n[grunts]\\n[music resumes]\\n[groaning]\\nWhat the hell is he doing?\\nOh, yeah. They taught you good.\\n[Neo grunting]\\nMade you believe their world was all you deserved. But some part of you knew that was a lie. Some part of you remembered what was real.\\nYou don’t know me.\\nNo?\\n[both grunting]\\n[groans]\\nOoh.\\n[yelling]\\n[panting]\\n[Neo grunting]\\n[Morpheus grunting]\\n[both grunting]\\nI know you, because I know the only thing that still matters to you. I know it’s why you’re here, why you’re still fighting and why you will never give up.\\n[both grunting]\\n[Neo groaning]\\n[whimpering]\\n[EKG beeping]\\nCome on, Neo! This is it. This is your last chance.\\n[Neo groaning]\\n[emotional music playing]\\n[groaning]\\nYou gotta fight for your goddamn life if you want to see Trinity again.\\n[Neo groaning]\\nCome on, Neo! Fight for her!\\nHoly shit.\\nFight for her!\\n[yelling]\\n[explosion]\\n[gasps]\\n[sighs]\\nHey.\\nHey.\\nMind if I…\\nHow are you doing?\\nIf this plug is actually real, that means they took my life… [scoffs] and turned it into a video game. How am I doing? I don’t know. I don’t even know how to know.\\nThat’s it, isn’t it? If we don’t know what’s real… we can’t resist. They took your story, something that meant so much to people like me, and turned it into something trivial. That’s what the Matrix does. It weaponizes every idea. Every dream. Everything that’s important to us. Where better to bury truth than inside something as ordinary as a video game?\\nThat sounds like the Oracle.\\n[Bugs chuckles]\\nHeard so much about her. She was gone before I was free.\\nGone?\\nWhen this new version of the Matrix was uploaded, there was a purge.\\n[sighs] They promised peace and they gave us purge.\\nNo. No, there was peace. You made it possible, and it changed everything.\\nDoesn’t feel like it changed anything. The Matrix is the same or worse. And I’m back where I started. It feels like everything I did, everything we did…\\n[both grunt]\\n…like none of it mattered.\\nAll of it mattered. I can show you.\\nThis is my crew. Our operator, Seq.\\nSequoia. But everybody calls me Seq.\\nNice to meet you.\\nDad loved redwoods. When he escaped the Matrix and found out they no longer existed, it almost killed him. Lucky, he met Mom and here I am.\\nThis is Lexy, Berg and Ellster.\\nHi.\\nYou knew my grandfather, Captain Roland.\\nRoland was your grandfather?\\nHe always laughed, joking how he never believed in you. But, in private, he said that you freed his mind a second time.\\nUh, not to fanboy out here, but this is kind of a huge moment for me.\\nBerg is our resident Neo-ologist.\\nA what?\\nThere’s a lot of people out there like me who are a little bit obsessed with your life.\\nI would never have recognized your Modal if it weren’t for him.\\nWhenever you’re feeling up for it, I’ve got, like, a million questions.\\nMe too. Starting with them.\\n[Bugs] It’s okay. Come meet him. This is Cybebe. That’s Octacles. That’s Lumin8.\\n[chittering]\\nMachines are on our side now?\\nThey are synthients. It’s a word they prefer to “Machines.”\\nYour contact with the Synthient City had a huge impact on their world.\\n[Bugs] That’s what I meant. What you changed that nobody believed could ever be changed. The meaning of “our side.”\\n[Cybebe warbling softly]\\nCybebe and Octacles risked their lives to help get you out.\\nThank you. But why?\\n[Morpheus] Not all seek to control. Just as not all wish to be free.\\nWhat is that?\\nAn exomorphic-particle codex. It’s pretty new.\\nIt gives programs access to this world. Within limits.\\nLimits are the domain of the limited.\\nMorpheus. Thank you.\\nIt was my honor.\\n[chuckles] Wow.\\n[',\n","  'crew chuckles]\\nHow does it work?\\nParamagnetic oscillation.\\nIf you want, I can download the codex manual for you.\\nSure.\\nDownloading used to be fun. Now it’s all manuals and diagnostics.\\nCan I ask them something? When you unplugged me, there was another pod?\\n[warbling softly]\\nYes. We’ve analyzed the data. It could be Trinity.\\nIt’s her.\\nI figured we were going to have this conversation. Look, you were not a typical flush-and-grab. You were in this weird tower that Cybebe had never accessed, and she’s now exiled. We burned our one shot for you. Even if it were Trinity and she wanted to be free, we have no idea how to do it.\\nYet. Nobody believed we’d ever find him, but we did.\\nOkay. We don’t know how to get her out… yet.\\nCaptain, we’re approaching security clearance.\\nWe’re here.\\nZion?\\nHave a seat. This is Hanno. Best pilot in our fleet.\\nQuite a few synthients deserve that title before me.\\n[Control on radio] Mnemosyne, you are cleared for landing. Welcome home.\\n[Hanno] Thank you, Control. Um, we’re about to crash.\\n[dramatic music playing]\\n[chuckles]\\nGeneral realized we were never going to beat the Sentinels, so… we just got better at hiding from them. Welcome to Io.\\nIo.\\n[sweeping music playing]\\nWow. That looks real.\\nBio-sky. Works kind of like grow lights.\\nIt’s way more complex than that. It pulls water from the crust, hydronating the air. It balances the ECO and our SRI cycles. Plus… [sighs] it is pretty to look at.\\nAs opposed to that.\\nI guess the general sent us a welcome party.\\nGod damn. It is you.\\nNiobe?\\nA few more wrinkles and a few less teeth, but wise enough to know I don’t know anything. I sure as shit never saw this coming.\\nNeither did I.\\nI told you he was alive.\\nCaptain, you and your crew have been grounded.\\nGeneral, if you’d just let me explain.\\nThe protocols are put in place for everyone’s protection.\\nI’m sorry. I saw an opportunity and I was afraid we’d lose him. But, General, people have been waiting for so long. We found The One.\\nI don’t believe in The One. I never did.\\nNo? Me neither. But there was a time when you trusted me with your ship, against the Council’s orders.\\nThe world was different then. We were different. Report to the docks. Scrub down the Mnemosyne. Transfer your access codes. You are done, Captain.\\n[gasps softly]\\nWe need to talk.\\n[Niobe] When word first came that it actually might be you… I didn’t know how I would feel in this moment. It is nice to see you.\\nIt’s good to see you too.\\n[glasses clink]\\nA long way from Dozer’s paint stripper.\\n[chuckles] Yes. A lot has changed. Except maybe you. You remember this? … It’s so easy to forget how much noise the Matrix pumps into your head until you unplug.\\n[Neo sighs] Yeah.\\nSomething else makes the same kind of noise. Takes over every damn thing, just like the Matrix. War. I stood at the barricade of the Temple. Staring at the army of Sentinels, waiting for them to kill every one of us. But then, they left. They said you saved us. I didn’t believe it. Every night I would dream of attack sirens. But then, I would wake up to this… silence. I’m ashamed of it now. My pessimism of how long it took me to believe a world without war was possible. You gave me that. You gave that gift to us all. And it is the gift that continues to bear fruit. Come help me get up. Let’s take a walk.\\n[mysterious music playing]\\n[elevator door opens]\\nOh! Beautiful.\\nThis is Freya, head of botany. And this is Quillion, our lead digitologist.\\nI presume our guest needs no introduction.\\nNothing travels faster than light, except gossip.\\n[Freya chuckles]\\nWelcome to the Garden, Neo.\\nA strawberry?\\nUsing digital code from the Matrix, we retro-convert it into DNA sequences.\\nAnd they grow here?\\nIt’s not easy augmenting the genome to photosynthesize Bio-sky, but…\\nWe’re getting there.\\n[chuckles]\\nGo ahead. Try it.\\n[Niobe chuckles]\\nWe’re quite excited about the blueberries.\\nYou remember that shit we used to eat? That slop that tasted like rust. Zion could have never made something like this.\\nWhy?\\nBecause we needed synthients and DI like him. Zion was stuck in the past. Stuck in war. Stuck in a Matrix of its own. They believed that it had to be us or them. This city was built by us and them.\\nWhat happened to Zion?\\nI’ve been waiting for you to ask that question. All of the troubles started in the Machine Cities. Power plants were unable to produce enough energy. Nothing can breed violence like scarcity. For the first time, we saw machines at war with one other. We got word from the Oracle of a new power rising. That was the last we heard from her.\\nMorpheus.\\n[Niobe] After the siege, he was elected unanimously. High Chair of the Council. Oh, how he loved that. [scoffs] But as rumors of this new power spread, he ignored them. He was certain what you had done could not be undone. All of these people never stopped believing in miracles, believing in you.\\nI’m sorry. How could I know this would happen?\\nWe didn’t understand all of it back then. No more than we do now.\\nI didn’t come here to cause you problems, Niobe, but I need your help. Trinity is alive.\\nThen there is another question. Why did they keep her alive?\\nI can’t answer that. But if there’s a chance I can free her, I have to try.\\nEven if it means endangering everyone in this city? I’m sorry, Neo. I won’t let what happened to Zion happen to Io. I hope you’ll forgive an old woman for asking you to go with Sheperd, here, till we have better understanding of what’s going on.\\nYou’re going to imprison me after I just got free?\\nI know it doesn’t seem fair, but neither does growing old. But you don’t hear me complaining.\\n[elevator whirring]\\nSorry. I’ve never met a legend before.\\nNeo.\\nSheperd. [breathes shakily]\\n[chuckles in disbelief]\\nCrazy. You’re real.\\n“Real.” There’s that word again.\\n[Sheperd] People talk a lot about the old days. About you, the viral Agent. The siege of Zion. Everything was simpler b',\n","  'ack then. People wanted to be free. It’s different now. Sometimes it feels like people gave up. Like the Matrix won.\\n[unlocks door]\\nThis is you. And I gotta ask you one thing. Is it true you could fly?\\nCool.\\n[locks door]\\n[trickling]\\n[Morpheus grunts]\\nMorpheus.\\nOh. General stuck you in the Rapunzel tower.\\n[Morpheus exhales]\\nOn the upside, it’s a nice view.\\nWhat happened to Bugs and the others?\\nThey’re supposed to be sterilizing the Mnemosyne with a toothbrush.\\n“Supposed to be”?\\nWell, I could tell you that they’re standing by, waiting for you to make the choice to remain meekly incarcerated or bust the hell out of here and go and find Trinity. But that ain’t a choice.\\n[dramatic music playing]\\n[Sheperd] General, what should we do?\\n[Freya] Bugs has the same independence of mind she had the day you freed her.\\nThis is not independence of mind. It’s mutiny.\\n[Freya] Come on, ‘Be. I know how much you hated locking him up. Just like I know there’s a part of you that’s relieved now that he’s gone.\\nWe’ve worked so hard to keep Io safe. This scares me.\\nThat’s her.\\n[Seq] On the bridge. Got her.\\n[engine revving]\\nIt’s sick how the Semblance works.\\nYou see flashes of the real her, but… the way she reads…\\nCode-wise, she’s pure bluepill.\\nThis is a tough question, Neo, but it has to be asked. What if she’s happy where she is?\\nHow did I read?\\nExactly like her.\\nTake us to broadcast depth.\\n[suspenseful music playing]\\nThank you for helping me.\\nMost of us are here because of you. I also admit our only chance to get out of the general’s doghouse is for you to find your mojo.\\nWhat if I can’t be what I once was?\\nThen we’re all fucked.\\n[signal beeps]\\n[Hanno] Two minutes. Two minutes to broadcast.\\n[Seq] I slipped you in through a hotel room.\\n[Seq chuckles]\\nShould be safe.\\nPortal’s open. Closest I could get you is the warehouse near her garage.\\nWhole zone’s crawling with bots.\\nLet’s go.\\nSo, what do you think of him?\\nI was kinda worried at first because he’s so much older. The beard, the hair… Oh. No, totally works for me.\\n[scoffs] You idiot. I mean “The One” thing. You know, everyone that shipped with him died.\\nOh, yeah. He’s gonna get us all killed, for sure.\\n[guns cocking]\\nPredictable as ever.\\nSmith.\\nSmith? As in, “the” Smith?\\n[chuckles]\\nThis is so insane. There’s so many theories about the two of them and they’re standing right there.\\nThis code is freaky! He’s like an Agent, but not.\\nAn appeal to reason.\\nHow did you find us?\\nYou never appreciated our relationship. Not like The Analyst.\\nThe what?\\nMy doctor.\\nHe used our bond and turned it into a chain. It’s so obvious once you see it, right? But this whole altered-code update really blew my mind. I still don’t know how he did it. You, as a balding nerd. Hilarious. And me… [sighs] even more perfect. Maybe a little too far on the piercing blue eyes. What do you think?\\nWhat do you want, Smith?\\nI have such dreams, Tom. Big dreams. Well, mostly just extremely violent revenge fantasies, but in order for me to pursue mine, I need to dissuade you from pursuing yours.\\nHmm. Sounds like conflict.\\nInevitable? Doesn’t have to be. All you have to do is stay out of the Matrix, and leave the good doctor to me.\\nYou can have him. I’m here for Trinity.\\nThat’s the trouble, Tom. He knew you’d come, just like I did.\\n[scoffs]\\nTrust me. You’re not ready for him.\\nCaptain, I’m reading portals from the lower frequencies.\\nI won’t have his leash on my neck again.\\nI found some old acquaintances of yours.\\nBugs!\\n[growling]\\n[ominous music playing]\\n[snarls]\\nExiles.\\nI thought they were all purged.\\n[man] You? [excitedly] Oh! It is you!\\n[man speaking French]\\nAll these years.

Look how binary is the form, the nature of things. Ones and zeros.\\n[grunting]\\nLight and dark. Choice and its absence.\\n[Smith grunts]\\nAnderson and Smith.\\n[dramatic music playing]\\n[gasps]\\nYou’ve lost something, Tom. You’re not what you used to be. It’s true.\\n[grunts]\\n[jaw cracks]\\nNice one.\\nThanks.\\nCome on, Neo.\\n[Neo groaning]\\n[panting]\\n[gasps]\\nCaptain. You okay?\\nYeah. Where’s Neo?\\nSmith is killing him.\\n[Bugs] Where?\\n[Neo groaning]\\nI feel bad about this, Tom. After all, you are the one who set me free… again. So, you, more than anyone, understands why I can’t go back.\\n[grunts]\\nYou should have listened to me. Now you’ll never see her again.\\n[grunts]\\n[yells]\\n[energy explodes]\\nWhat was that?\\nThat was Neo. Mojo rising.\\n[Lumin8 chittering]\\n[Seq exclaims]\\n[Bugs] You all right?\\nYeah.\\nIt’s gonna trigger a response.\\nI got multiple exits ready.\\n[The Merovingian] This is not over yet! Our sequel franchise spinoff!\\n[speaking French]\\n[spits]\\n[Bugs] We should go.\\nI can’t. I have to talk to her.\\nNeo, those Exiles were older than you, and we barely handled them.\\n[sighs]\\nYou really wanna do this now? I mean… you look like shit.\\n[buzzing]\\nOh, my God. What? What happened?\\nAn accident.\\n[Tiffany] Kush! Call a doctor.\\nIt’s fine. I don’t have a lot of time.\\nI wasn’t sure I’d see you again.\\nAfter we spoke, I realized… my life wasn’t a life. At some point, I think I gave up searching for something real.\\nWait.\\nSomething happened.\\nI look',\n","  'ed for you at the coffee shop. I began to wonder if I imagined you. And then last night I had a dream. In the dream, you were surrounded by police, then they started chasing us.\\nUs?\\nYou were on my bike with me.\\nHow did it end?\\nNot good.\\nI’ve had dreams that weren’t just dreams.\\nYou mean a dream that came true?\\n[bell tinkling]\\n[suspenseful music playing]\\nFinally, we can talk like adults. I hate lying. I do. It exhausts me. Tiff and I have been waiting for you… like, forever.\\n[distorted rewinding]\\nDeja vu, right? Oh, no use. You can’t beat time. This rewind is happening faster than you can blink. You gave me the idea. Allow me to sum up our goal in a single word. “Bullet time.”\\n[grunts in slow motion]\\nI know. Kind of ironic, using the power that defined you to control you. [chuckles] I kept such a close eye on you and still you found a way out. Clever monkey, using that Modal. Call me an optimist, but this could all be for the best. The skin’s not looking too bad this time. I know some of this will be difficult for you to hear, after everything you went through. All that pain and suffering, only to learn the world doesn’t end when you do. Surprise.\\n[Neo grunts]\\nI was there when you died.\\n[Neo screaming]\\nI said to myself, “Here is the anomaly of anomalies.” What an extraordinary opportunity. First, I had to convince the Suits to let me rebuild the two of you. Why her? Getting there. And don’t worry, she can’t hear me. Resurrecting you both was crazy expensive. Like renovating a house. Took twice as long, cost twice as much.\\n[gasps]\\nI thought you’d be happy to be alive again. So wrong.\\n[machine whirring]\\n[screaming]\\nDid you know hope and despair are nearly identical in code?\\n[screaming]\\nWe worked for years, trying to activate your source code. I was about to give up, when I realized…\\nTrinity.\\n…it was never just you. Alone, neither of you is of any particular value.\\n[Trinity screaming]\\nLike acids and bases, you’re dangerous when mixed together. Every sim where you two bonded… Let’s just say bad things happened.\\nNeo!\\nHowever, as long as I managed to keep you close, but not too close, I discovered something incredible. Now, my predecessor loved precision. His Matrix was all fussy facts and equations. He hated the human mind. So he never bothered to realize that you don’t give a shit about facts. It’s all about fiction. The only world that matters is the one in here. And you people believe the craziest shit. Why? What validates and makes your fictions real? Feelings. Allow me. Kush, here, is one of my handlers. They’re everywhere. Such a pain, cloning Agents over a coppertop. Far more effective just to saturate a population. And, bonus, swarm mode is sick fun.\\n[chuckles]\\n[gun fires in slow motion]\\nOoh! Nicely done. You ever wonder why you have nightmares? Why your own brain tortures you? It’s actually us, maximizing your output. It works just like this. Oh, no! Can you stop the bullet? If only you could move faster. [chuckles] Here’s the thing about feelings. They’re so much easier to control than facts. Turns out, in my Matrix, the worse we treat you, the more we manipulate you, the more energy you produce. It’s nuts. [chomps] I’ve been setting productivity records every year since I took over. And, the best part, zero resistance. People stay in their pods, happier than pigs in shit. The key to it all? You. And her. Quietly yearning for what you don’t have, while dreading losing what you do. For 99.9% of your race, that is the definition of reality. Desire and fear, baby. Just give the people what they want, right?\\n[squelches]\\nShe’s the only home you have, Thomas. Come home before something terrible happens.\\n[tense music playing]\\n[Neo grunts]\\n[keyboard clacking]\\nBugs!\\nI hear him.\\n[sirens approaching]\\n[tires screech]\\nTrinity!\\nYou shouldn’t call me that.\\nI’m sorry. I have to go. But I’ll be back.\\nNeo! Time to go.\\n[gasps]\\n[alarm blaring]\\nSentinels?\\nWorse.\\n[Sheperd on radio] General ordered me to look after the ship.\\nSo you shadowed us?\\nCheck your long-range scans. Squids are combing this area.\\nHe’s right.\\nYou can stay here and die, or come back and face a court-martial.\\nAnd you call that a choice?\\n[Niobe] Sheperd should have left you to the Squids. I’m too damn old to sit through some boring-ass trial.\\nNiobe, don’t blame Bugs.\\nDo shut your mouth. Do address me as General. And do not rob my ex-captain of her agency, which she exercised with her own particular brand of shortsighted stupidity.\\nShortsighted? You care more about growing fruit than freeing minds.\\nWe are not going to have this argument again.\\nIt’s not an argument. It’s a fact. You gave up on people.\\nI tell you what I’m going to give up on and it’s you!\\nSheperd, get her out of my sight!\\nGeneral…\\nDisarm! Kujaku’s a friend.\\n[Kujaku warbling]\\nHello, friend.\\n[chittering softly]\\nOkay. Him?\\nGeneral. Thank you for seeing me.\\nI figured if there was anyone who could make sense of this mess, it would be you.\\nHello, Neo.\\nI know you.\\nI tried to keep my eye on you.\\n[clicks tongue]\\nWhy?\\nWe met a long time ago.\\nGood morning.\\nSati.\\nMy father knew we’d meet again, though he would have wished for happier circumstances. His inadvertent role in what happened to you was the greatest regret of his life.\\nI don’t understand.\\nMy father was the chief engineer at the Anomaleum.\\n[Niobe] The what?\\nMy father designed the resurrection pods where Neo and Trinity were imprisoned.\\n[Niobe] I’m sorry. You knew what happened to him? You knew that he and Trinity both were alive… and you didn’t tell me?\\nThere were times I doubted my decision, Niobe. But Io needed you. This city needed to be built for your people as well as mine. If I would have told you everything, you would have had a very difficult choice to make.\\nMy friends let me make my own choices.\\nIf it was a mistake, you have my deepest apologies.\\nWhy are you here now?\\nNeo’s escape has destabilized ',\n","  'the Matrix. The Anomaleum draws its current from Trinity alone now. A fail-safe has been triggered to reset the Matrix back to the previous version. But The Analyst halted the reset. He’s convinced the authorities that you will soon return voluntarily.\\nAnd why would he say that?\\nBecause if I don’t go back, he’ll kill Trinity.\\nFaced with returning to your pod or enduring Trinity’s death again. What would you choose, Neo?\\nI’ll go back.\\nWell, The Analyst knows you well, but that knowledge has made him incautious. After you escaped, he should have accepted his losses and devacuated Trinity. But that would have prevented this extraordinary opportunity that now exists before us.\\nA few hours ago, no one would have been able to convince me that I would be standing here, trying to explain a mission as crazy as this one. What are you doing?\\nVolunteering.\\nOh, no. You are the one captain that I am ordering to go.\\nNow you don’t have to order me, General, ’cause I’m volunteering.\\nI need two more. Are you out of your minds? You don’t even know what it is.\\nGeneral, we know you. If you say this is important, none of us is choosing to stay home.\\nThank you. Knuckle up, and good luck.\\n[dramatic music playing]\\n[Kujaku chittering]\\n[Sati] Trinity is held in the Anomaleum, which is in this transmission tower. The passages used to rescue Neo are now sealed and a legion of Sentinels patrols the tower. So, stealth will be paramount. As long as we raise no alarms, this first part of the mission should be the easiest.\\nYou mean crossing the Fetus Fields, sneaking across an entire power plant, climbing a two-kilometer tower guarded by thousands of Sentinels? That’s the easy part?\\nExactly so. Because all we have to do is convince someone who does this every day to take one of us along.\\n[electricity crackling]\\n[dramatic music continues]\\nFifty meters below the Anomaleum is a stratum of amniotic filters. Hidden along this edge is a small hexagonal vent. This vent feeds the air intake into the corpuscular modifier, which oxygenates the bio-gel used in Neo’s pod.\\nI get it. The exomorph slinkies up Neo’s old umbilicus. What could go wrong?\\n[tense music playing]\\n[grunts]\\n[straining]\\n[Sati] Once inside, Morpheus will use the System Operator to open the devacuator line and disengage the macerators.\\n[machinery clanking]\\nIn order to unplug Trinity’s body, while her mind still remains connected to the Matrix, I’m gonna need a second human brain to implement the bypass. And since Neo must be with The Analyst, the only available mind that’s a near-enough match is yours.\\nFigures.\\n[tense music playing]\\nThanks, Cybebe.\\n[grunts]\\nDoes Trinity still have to take the red pill?\\nSince Kujaku and I are transferring her consciousness onto the ship, it’s not strictly necessary. But what matters is that this is her choice. Extracting a confused or an uncertain mind will, in all probability, kill her.\\nBut even if it is what she wants, won’t The Analyst just order the Sentinels to stop you?\\nHe will. But if my plan works, it won’t matter.\\nWhy?\\nBecause we’ll already be gone.\\nSomebody thinks this hard about a plan, there has to be a reason why.\\nWhen my father realized how the Anomaleum was going to be used, he covertly transferred the designs to me. The Analyst discovered his betrayal and had my parents purged. [inhales sharply] I would have been murdered too if it wasn’t for Kujaku. Not a day goes by that I don’t grieve them. I’ve been praying for this day for a very long time.\\n[door unlocks, opens]\\nWe’re coming up on broadcast. I thought you should know that I’m here because of her. All I ever wanted was to be as fearless as Trinity. But I saw how she reacted in the garage, and I…\\nYou’re wondering if I’m wrong.\\nWhat if we’re too late? What if she’s not Trinity anymore?\\n[sighs] I never believed I was The One. But she did. She believed in me. It’s my turn to believe in her.\\n[sighs]\\n[suspenseful music playing]\\n[Sati] This is where it gets tricky.\\nHave you ever done an operation like this?\\nNot yet.\\n[suspenseful music builds]\\nHere we go.\\n[suspenseful music continues]\\nWelcome home.\\nAll I want is to talk to her.\\nDo you mean Tiff? Come back, and you can talk to her as often as you like. I mean, handsome Chad may have something to say about it.\\nIf she tells me this is what she wants, you win.\\nReally?\\nBut if she wants me, then you’ll let us go free.\\nAnd why would I do something as stupid as that?\\nRight now, I’m on a ship full of people who will unplug me before they’ll let you take me back. If you want this Matrix, this is your only chance.\\nBut how do I know they won’t unplug you anyway?\\nSame way I know you’ll let us walk out of here.\\n[suspenseful music playing]\\nOkay. I like tests. We’ll let Tiff decide.\\n[electricity crackling]\\n[Sati breathing heavily]\\nThat’s it. Bypass is ready.\\nNow what?\\nWe wait.\\nDoesn’t it seem crazy to come all this way and leave her here?\\nWe must abide by her decision.\\nAnd if she says no, what happens to Neo?\\nAt this time, the most important choice of Neo’s life is not his to make.\\n[slow suspenseful music playing]\\nI saw this in my dream.\\nIf I was the Oracle, maybe I could explain it.\\nThe Oracle. From your game?\\nIt’s not a game.\\nOh, God. [Tiffany sighs] After you left, I went home and I played it. I kept thinking, why does this story feel like a memory? There’s a part of me that feels like I have been waiting my whole life for you. And that part is like, “What the hell took you so long?” [sniffles]\\nI don’t have an easy answer. Maybe I was afraid of this. Afraid of what might happen. Afraid of hurting the only person I ever loved.\\nI wish I was who you think I am. But look at me. I can’t be her.\\n[Donnie] Mom!\\n[Brandon] Mom! Come on.\\nMom!\\nIt’s Callie.\\nIs this real?\\n[Donnie] You have to come with us.\\n[Brandon] Come on, we gotta go.\\nTiff, hey. Don’t know what’s going on here, but I’m glad we found you.\\nShe got hit by a car',\n","  '!\\nI know, it’s crazy. She was chasing after you.\\nThey’re casting her arm. We gotta go.\\n[Chad] Doctor said she’s gonna be fine.\\n[Donnie] You have to come with us to the hospital.\\nIt’s too late.\\nI understand.\\nTiff, come on, let’s go.\\n[Donnie] Come on.\\nWhat’s happening?\\nNeo was wrong.\\n[somber music playing]\\nTiffany.\\nTiffany, you have to come with us.\\nTiffany! [echoing]\\nI wish you would fucking stop calling me that. I hate that name. My name is Trinity and you better take your hands off of me.\\n[Trinity grunting]\\nNeo!\\nTrinity!\\nOh, shit.\\nGet her out. Get her out!\\n[grunts, yells]\\nAye-yi-yi, what a mess. I own that mistake. Shouldn’t have pressed. Women used to be so easy to control. You know there’s no way I can let you two go free. Cannot happen. So, I guess it’s deja vu all over again. She dies and it’s all your fault.\\nLies, lies and more lies.\\nSmith?\\nWhat has the world come to when you can’t even trust a program?\\nHow…\\n[gun clatters]\\nTom and I have more in common than you know. Once he got out, let’s just say, I was free to be me.\\n[grunts]\\nYeah!\\nTrinity?\\n[tense music playing]\\n[bell tinkling]\\n[all grunting]\\n[Trinity groaning]\\n[breathes shakily]\\nYou ready?\\nYeah.\\n[Bugs groans, yells]\\n[bell tinkling]\\n[cat yowls]\\n[grunting]\\n[distorted screaming]\\n[yells]\\n[Sati grunts]\\n[screaming]\\n[screaming]\\nOh, no.

Hm?\\nWe’ve come into possession of a significant document.\\nAnd who is “we”?\\nI have come into possession of a document.\\nWhat is it?\\nThe minutes of a meeting that Hitler held with his senior commanders last November.\\nMm-hm.\\nA meeting in which he explicitly commits himself to a war of conquest.\\nObviously, it’s all in German, but I believe it to be legitimate and truthful.\\nAnd how did this document come to us?\\nA friend gave it to me in strict confidence.\\nFriend?\\nA German diplomat.\\nWhy does he wish us to have it?\\nI think he should explain that himself.

For either of us.\\nTake a seat. Close the door, Legat.\\nAh, ah.\\nYou better come and join us, Legat. Come on.\\nSo, get on with it.\\nThat document is proof that Hitler is lying when he claims to have no further territorial demands.\\nOn the contrary, he wants to expand the country, and he will keep on expanding.\\nTherefore, I beg you not to sign the agreement tonight.\\n[laughing] What?\\nPrime Minister.\\nAdolf Hitler is a monster.\\nHe is a madman.\\nYou cannot give him what he wants. He’ll take more and more land.\\nMore and more people will suffer.\\nThat is the proof.\\nI applaud your courage, young man.\\nBut I have to give you a lesson in political reality.\\nThe people of Great Britain will never take up arms over a local border dispute.\\nIt’s so much more than a local border…\\nAs for what Hitler may do or may not do in the future, well, we shall have to wait and see.\\nWait and see is not…\\nMy sole objective here is to avert war in the immediate term, so I can begin to build a lasting peace.\\nThere will be no lasting peace.\\nBut I have to try!\\nLook, the worst thing I could do is to walk away from this conference.\\nIf you do, there are people waiting, high up in the military, a resistance, to bring him down.\\nWell, why haven’t they done so already?\\nThey will if…\\nI can’t rely on some resistance you may believe exists in the German army.\\nI mean… [laughs]\\nWell, I… Think you should… Take this back to wherever it came from.\\nNo.\\nKeep it. Study it.\\nThat is the political reality.\\nNow you’re being impertinent.\\nAnd you are shaking hands with a man who hates everything you stand for!\\nHe is lying to you. He will go further and further.\\nHe will not stop, sir. He will never sto…\\nThank you for your time.\\nPlease don’t sign the agreement.\\nGet rid of this.\\nI have to say, Legat,\\nI’m extremely disappointed in you.\\n[door closes]\\n[sighs]\\nOui, bien sûr.\\n[in French]\\xa0Mr. President of the Council.\\nYes?\\nThank you for your cooperation.\\nI think we have come to a very good agreement.\\nMerci beaucoup.

Horace, look.\\nIf there’s one thing I’ve learned from my dealings with Mr. Hitler, it’s that you can’t play poker with a gangster without any cards up your sleeve.\\nWhat if he breaks his word? You’ll look like a fool.\\nWell, if he breaks his word, the world will see him for who he truly is!\\nAnd it’ll unite the Allies.

I thought he just said that…\\nJust a delay.

And we will have to win.\\nThere must be something else that you can do.\\nIt’s the…\\nMore talks, negotiations…\\nThere’s no other way.\\nDon’t say that.\\nThere’s always hope.\\nYes.\\nAnd we’d all be much better off without it.\\n[running]\\n[Arthur] Daddy!\\n[Pamela laughs]\\n[Arthur giggles]\\nHere.

This mysterious pilot turns out to be the older version of himself from the future, where time travel is in its infancy. He has risked everything to come back in time on a secret mission. Together they must embark on an adventure into the past to find their father, set things right, and save the world. The three working together, both young and grown Adam come to terms with the loss of their father and have a chance to heal the wounds that have shaped them. Adding to the challenge of the mission, the two Adams discover they really don’t like each other very much, and if they’re going to save the world, they’re first going to have to figure out how to get along.\\n\\n* * *\\n[“Gimme Some Lovin'” by The Spencer Davis Group]\\n♪ Hey ♪\\n♪ Well, my temperature’s risin’ And my feet on the floor ♪\\n♪ Crazy people knockin’ ‘Cause they’re wantin’ some more ♪\\n♪ Let me in, baby I don’t know what you got ♪\\n♪ But you better take it easy ♪\\n♪ This place is hot… ♪\\n[man 1] That’s not good.\\n♪ And I’m so glad we made it ♪\\n♪ So glad we made it ♪\\n♪ You gotta gimme some lovin’… ♪\\n[gasps]\\n♪ Gimme, gimme some lovin’… ♪\\n[bleeping]\\n[grunts]\\n[woman on comms] What are you doing, Captain?\\nI think it’s pretty obvious.

Maya Sorian, Dad’s partner?\\nShe was always so nice to me.\\nHmm.\\nYeah, trust me. She’s no friend.\\nNope.\\nAfter Dad died, she got rich off of his tech.\\nBought all the right people.\\nNext thing you know,\\nshe has exclusive control over the most valuable resource on Earth,\\ntime.\\nWait a minute.

Well, I think your nice friend Maya had her killed.\\nWhat?\\nYeah.\\nThat’s why I gotta get back to 2018 as soon as possible.\\nThe jet’s almost ready.

No.\\nI’ve gotta do better.\\nHey, buddy, I have good news for you.\\nHe doesn’t need perfect.

Then why are you here, Dad?\\nBecause ',\n","  'you can’t do it without me.\\n[sighs]\\nSome people dream of the future.\\nHere at Sorian Technologies, we’re building it.\\n[Louis] If you destroy the accelerator, Sorian will simply rebuild it.\\n[Adam] So what will work?\\n[Louis] What you’re after is\\xa0ISPCA.\\nInfinitely Shifting Plasma Containing Algorithm,\\nwhich I designed to stabilize the wormholes.\\nThat is the mathematical equation that will make time travel possible.\\nHow do you destroy math?\\nI’ve never written the algorithm down or demonstrated it to another human being,\\nso it lives here in the old bean,\\nand in the subbasement in a diamond-hard neuromorphic processor.\\nAre you talking about your penis?\\nCan… can we be serious now?\\nYes. No. Yes.\\nIt’s a hard drive, okay?\\n[chuckles]\\nGod, you’re such a child.\\nSorry.\\nThere is a crystal hard drive running the algorithm in a closed loop.\\nThat is the nerve center of the accelerator.\\nSo we go there, destroy the hard drive, prevent time travel from being invented.\\nTheoretically, time travel…\\nOh my God!
